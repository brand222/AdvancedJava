		 * The CONSUMER interface is a part of the java.util.function package.
		 * Consumers represent a function which takes in one argument and produces 
		 * a result. However, these kinds of functions don't return any value.
		 * 
		 * 
		 * The lambda expression assigned to an object of Consumer type is used to
		 * define it's accept() which eventually applies the given operation to it's argument
		 * Consumers are useful when you do not need to return any value as they are expected to
		 * operate via side-effects.
		 * 
		 * The Consumer interfa consists of two methods: accept() and andThen()
