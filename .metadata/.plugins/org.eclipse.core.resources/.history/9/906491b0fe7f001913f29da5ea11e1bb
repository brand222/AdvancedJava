//A stack uses a last in, first out order (LIFO)

//it is a vertical stack of objects

//when you pull an element off a stack, the last element is the first one to come out
//items are added on one end and deleted on the same end
//Think of it like a 'stack of plates'
//to add, you push()
//to remove, you pop()
//peek() method makes a copy of the first item
//a stack is an easy way to reverse a collection of values
