Collections are a way to store objects into a container for which you can iterate over.

Questions to ask when using a collection

1) Does the order matter?
2) Are duplicates allowed?
3) How fast will this operation take?
4) How much memory is being used?


Iterable - all types of collection implement Iterable

Collection extends Iterable: Collection interface declares all the methods that a collection must have
For ex. at(), remove(), isEmpty(), toArray() etc...

3 types of collections:

1) Sets - Do not allow duplicates
- No Duplicates
- Unordered

2) Lists
- Duplicates are allowed
- Order of elements is significant


3) Queues
- FIFO - first in first out operations
- Like a real-life queue

4) Maps
- Do not extend collections interface
- Contains key-value pairs
